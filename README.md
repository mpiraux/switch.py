switch.py is a simple switch automation web application. 

It is written in Python and uses the Flask framework. It aims at being a simple application to schedule switch activation while being switch agnostic. You can define how to actuate your switch and switch.py will take care of the rest.

switch.py is under heavy development at the moment, you should probably wait for the first release to consider deploying it. A proper user documentation will be written at that time too.
